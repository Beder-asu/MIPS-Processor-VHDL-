# MIPS-Processor-VHDL-
Designing and implementing a simple MIPS processor using Xilinx and VHDL, focusing on foundational concepts of computer architecture and digital logic design. To enhance performance, the processor was further optimized with a four-stage pipeline, improving instruction throughput and demonstrating key principles of pipelining in modern processors.
